### What makes Ink different?
Ink is an OP Stack Layer 2 launched 1-second blocktimes. What sets us apart is our dedication to building a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem while staying true to our origins. Our mission is to simplify DeFi while bringing Kraken’s core principles—security, user experience, and privacy—onchain.

We embrace our cypherpunk roots by shipping rapidly and iteratively. Feedback from users, developers, and the broader onchain community is vital to us as we strive to create the ultimate platform for achieving individual financial sovereignty.
